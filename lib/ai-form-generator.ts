1. What is a linked list and how does it differ from an array in terms of memory allocation?
2. Write a function to insert a new node at the beginning of a singly linked list.
3. Implement an algorithm to reverse a linked list iteratively.
4. How would you detect if a linked list has a cycle? Explain Floyd's algorithm.
5. Compare the time complexity of searching in a linked list versus an array.
